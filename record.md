Compare win rate of the three agents：
- greedy
- minimax
- RL

TODO:   
- Use DQN to construct NN model. (Like HW4, try 100 or 200 games for training, then combat with other type of agents)
- First, try to define state, nextstate, rewards as alpha-bata prune does, which is computing the average distance of pieces.

- state/observation: board
- reward: distance
- action_dimension: we cannot define (depends on state)
- player8 was late for 30 minutes :(

- player8 come up with a brand new algorithm
